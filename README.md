![](demo.gif)

## Brief Introduction

The purpose of starting this project is to build a **mobile-first** single page website using the CSS Grid. In this exercise, I will use modern techniques including relative em units, media queries, and even a little flex.
The project has not got anything like containers it only consists of four different sections and spans the content two to four.
The grid is going to go inside of a CSS media query for only on screen size is larger than 700 pixels.
